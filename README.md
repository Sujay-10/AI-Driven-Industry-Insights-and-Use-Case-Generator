# Industry Research and Generative AI Use Case Generator  

This project is designed to streamline industry research and use case generation by leveraging Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). It automates the process of researching industries, generating relevant AI and ML-based use cases, and gathering datasets and resources for practical applications. The project is built using LangChain, Google Generative AI (Gemini), and Streamlit to provide a user-friendly interface for interaction.

## Overview:-
This project enables users to:

* ***Conduct Industry Research***: Automatically generate industry-specific research reports on AI and ML trends using Google Gemini's LLM.  
* ***Generate Use Cases***: Propose relevant use cases for AI and ML applications based on industry research.  
* ***Resource Collection***: Gather trusted datasets and resources from Kaggle, Hugging Face, and GitHub to support proposed use cases.  
* ***Export Results***: Save generated research, use cases, and datasets to text files for further use.  
It is a tool that simplifies the workflow of identifying potential AI/ML use cases for a given industry and then provides actionable resources for implementation.  
  
## Key Features:-
* ***Industry Research Automation***: Instantly generate industry research summaries focusing on AI/ML trends.  
* ***Use Case Generation***: Automatically suggest AI/ML use cases tailored to the specified industry.  
* ***Dataset and Resource Collection***: Retrieve relevant datasets and resources from trusted sources (Kaggle, Hugging Face, GitHub).  
* ***Text File Export***: Export research results, use cases, and dataset links to text files.  
* ***Streamlit-Based UI***: Easy-to-use web interface for interaction.  
  
## How It Works:-
* 1. ***Input***: The user provides the name of an industry or company in the web interface.  
* 2. ***Industry Research***: The project uses the Google Gemini LLM to conduct research based on the provided industry, focusing on AI and ML trends.  
* 3. ***Use Case Generation***: Once the research is complete, the system generates use cases where AI, Generative AI, and Machine Learning technologies can be applied to improve processes.  
* 4. ***Resource Collection***: Finally, the system fetches datasets and resources from trusted sources (like Kaggle) that are relevant to the proposed use cases.  
* 5. ***Output***: The results (industry research, use cases, resources) are displayed on the UI and saved to respective text files.  
  
## Installation:-
### Prerequisites:
* Python 3.8 or higher  
* A valid API key for Google Gemini (Google Generative AI)  
* Streamlit, LangChain, and other required Python libraries (see requirements.txt)  
  
### Steps:  
* 1. Clone the repository  
* 2. Create and activate a virtual environment  
* 3. Install the required packages  
* 4. Set up environment variables  
* 5. Run the application    
  
## Usage:-
* 1. Open the Streamlit interface at http://localhost:8501/.  
* 2. Enter the industry or company you want to research in the input field.  
* 3. Click the Submit button to generate:  
  * Industry Research: A detailed summary of key trends and standards in AI and ML for the specified industry.  
  * Use Cases: Proposed use cases for AI, ML, and Generative AI applications.  
  * Resource Links: Datasets and resources from trusted sources like Kaggle, Hugging Face, and GitHub for each use case.  
* 4. The generated results will be saved in three text files: research_results.txt, use_cases.txt, and resources.txt.  
  
## Example:
For the E-commerce industry:
  * **Industry Research**: Trends like personalization, AI-powered recommendations, and logistics optimization.
  * **Use Cases**: Automated customer service, product recommendation engines, and inventory management.
  * **Resources**: Datasets from Kaggle, GitHub links for ML models, etc.

## Technologies Used:-
* 1. ***LangChain***: Framework for building LLM-powered applications.
* 2. ***Google Generative AI (Gemini)***: Used for generating research reports and use cases.
* 3. ***Streamlit***: Provides the UI for user interaction.
* 4. ***Pydantic***: For type validation and custom configurations.
* 5. ***Python***: Core programming language for the application.
